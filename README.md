Step 1: Building the Website Structure with HTML
The foundation of the website is created using the index.html file. This file defines all the content and structural elements that appear on the page.

Header Creation: A <header> element is used to contain the main navigation sections.

Primary Navigation (navbar): The top navigation bar is a div with the class navbar. It holds the logo, delivery address, search bar, sign-in options, and the cart icon.

Secondary Navigation (panel): Below the main navbar, a div with the class panel acts as a secondary menu, containing links like "Today's Deals" and "Customer Service".

Hero Section: A div with the class hero-section is created to act as the main promotional banner on the homepage.

Shop Section: A div with the class shop-section is used to hold all the product category boxes.

Product Boxes: Inside the shop section, individual div elements with the class box are created for each category, such as "Clothes," "Furniture," and "Electronics".

Footer: A <footer> element contains the bottom part of the page, which is divided into four panels (foot-panel1 to foot-panel4) for links and copyright information.
Step 2: Applying Visual Style with CSS
The style.css file is responsible for the website's appearance, from layout and colors to fonts and spacing.

Layout and Positioning: CSS Flexbox (display: flex) is used to arrange elements. For example, it aligns items horizontally in the .navbar and .shop-section to create a clean, organized layout.

Styling the Boxes: The .box class in CSS defines the height, width, background color, and padding for each product category card.

Color and Font: The CSS file sets the background colors for the navbar (#0f1111), panels (#222f3d), and footer sections. It also defines the font family (Arial) for the entire page.

Hover Effects: Interactive feedback is created using the :hover pseudo-class. For instance, the .border:hover rule adds a white border to navigation elements when a user's mouse moves over them.

Step 3: Integrating Images
Images are used to provide the logo, promotional content, and product visuals. They are primarily applied using CSS background properties.

Logo: The amazon_logo.png is applied as a background-image to any element with the class logo, such as in the navbar and footer.

Hero Image: The hero_image.jpg is set as the background-image for the .hero-section. The background-size: cover; property ensures the image always fills the entire section.

Product Images: In the index.html file, each product box contains a div with a box-img class and an inline style to set its specific background image (e.g., style="background-image: url('box1_image.jpg');"). The .box-img class in style.css then defines the height and sizing for these images.

Step 4: How It All Comes Together
When you open the index.html file in a web browser, the following happens:

The browser reads the index.html file to understand the structure and content of the page.

It then fetches and applies the rules from the linked style.css file, arranging the HTML elements and applying the specified colors, fonts, and spacing.

The browser loads the image files (amazon_logo.png, hero_image.jpg, etc.) and displays them in their designated places as backgrounds.

The final result is a static but visually accurate clone of the Amazon homepage, where all the structural and style elements work together to create the complete design.
